# Terraform

Terraform is a infrastructure as a code tool that allow you to manage the infrastructure with the configuration files rather than the graphical user interface.
It allows you to build,change and manage the infrastructure in consistent and the repeatible way.

Using Terraform has serveral advantages over manually managing your infrastructure.

* Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platform.
* The human-readable configuration language helps to write infrastructure code quickly.
* It helps you to track the resources throughout the deployments.
* You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure.

To deploy the resources with the Terraform, standardized method should be followed.

* **Scope** of the Project i.e., understand the infrastructure of the project.
* **Author** i.e., write the configuration for you infrastructure.
* **Initialize** i.e., Install all the plugin that is required to manage the infrastructure.
* **Plan** i.e., Preview the changes and see is it really matching your actual configration.
